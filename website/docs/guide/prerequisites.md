# Prerequisites

## Vitepress project

If you are planning to use this plugin, you likely already have a VitePress project. If not, check [here](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started) and follow the instruction to get started.

## static-templ-plus

To pre-render the components, [static-templ-plus](https://github.com/indaco/static-templ-plus) works under the hood.

```bash
go install github.com/indaco/static-templ-plus@latest
```

## templ (optional)

If you are planning to use this plugin, `templ` is likely already in your toolbox. If not, you should consider adding it.

```bash
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
```
